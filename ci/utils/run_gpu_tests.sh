# Run the GPU-marked pytest suite inside the CUDA container used by the GPU
# CI lanes, from the repo root. Shared by the post-merge lane
# (.github/workflows/main.yml) and the per-PR lane (.github/workflows/pr.yaml)
# so the two cannot drift.
#
# Usage: ci/utils/run_gpu_tests.sh [CUDA_EXTRA]
#   CUDA_EXTRA  uv extra providing the GPU stack (default: cuda13)
#
# Note on coverage: the `cuda13` extra tracks cuOpt 26.04, which has no
# QCQP/SOCP support, so the variance-cap tests skip themselves there (see the
# require_cuopt_socp fixture in tests/conftest.py). Use `cuda12` or
# `cuda13-socp` to exercise those paths.
#
# When CUDA_EXTRA is a SOCP-capable extra, the installed cuOpt is asserted to
# be >= 26.06 before the suite runs. Without that assertion a misresolved
# environment would skip every SOCP test and still exit 0, so the lane would
# report green while testing nothing.
